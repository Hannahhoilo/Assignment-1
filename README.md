In this project I am using the SWAPI API (https://swapi.dev/) to fetch and display data on different Star Wars facts. Here you can see facts about different planets, vehicles, character and all of the films. I render the details for each category with a asynchronous fetching.

I get different data for each category, and renders them on my page. Each category is separated in different pages, and in these pages I have made the info render into lists so you could easily read the information. 

Since the API did not include any pictures, I manually rendered them by looping trough my picture maps, so they will match correctly in all of my categories.

On the bottom of my page I have a button that renders more as you scroll down.
